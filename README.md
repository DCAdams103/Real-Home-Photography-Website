# Real Home Photography Website

### Made for a local real estate photography company.

### Developed with mainly ReactJS and Bootstrap.

### Deployed with Firebase on www.rhomephotography.com

## To run the project, run the following command in the project directory:
  - `npm start`

## This project I did from start to finish allowed me to learn a lot <br/> about React,CSS, HTML, and web development as a whole.

## I used the following libraries to make this website complete:
  - <b>![react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)</b> ( For links to different pages )
  - <b>![material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)</b> ( For styling of contact form )
  - <b>![react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)</b> ( For styling of other pages )
  - <b>![react-reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/docs/)</b> ( For animations done with images )
  - <b>![react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive)</b> ( For MediaQuery tags to improve responsiveness )
  - <b>![firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)</b> ( For deployment )
  - <b>![emailjs-com](https://www.emailjs.com/)</b> ( For sending emails from the contact form )
